Moonshot
========================

Create a simple app with an architecture that can do cool stuff. This is really only for demo/learning purposes.

##CI/CD
We'll use jenkins for this in the main

##Packaging
We'll use packer to create our container images

##Config Management
We'll use ansible for config management

##Platform
We'll use azure because they give you free stuff

##Infrastructure
We'll use terraform to create the azure resources
